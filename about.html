<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height:30px; margin-bottom:50px;">There are many different types of cake receipes and numerous ways of categorizing them.  <br>The general clasification used is whether or not they contain fat, also known as shortening (not the be confused solely with just processed shrotening ),and are called SHORTENED (BUTTER OR OIL) CAKES or UNSHORTENED (FOAM)CAKES.  <br>Chiffon Cakes make up the third category, but here they are often included with unshortened(foam) cakes.  <br>When chemical leavening was discovered in Europe in the mid-1th century, it became possible to replace some of the egg in the pound cake with liquids like milk, giving rise to the present day American Butter Cake.  The Chiffon Cake, a cross between the old-style European Sponge Cake and the American Butter Cake was the invention of an American aptly named Harry Baker, a Los Angeles insurance salesman.  </p>
